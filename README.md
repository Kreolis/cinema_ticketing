# Cinema Ticketing System

This is a **Django-based event ticketing system** that allows users to view events, select tickets, and make payments using several different payment gateways. 
The project tracks available seats for each event, handles ticket purchases, and integrates with `django-payments` for seamless payment processing.

### üöÄ Features

- **Event Management**: Create, update, and display events with customizable seat limits and price classes.
- **Ticketing**: Dynamically assign unique seat numbers to tickets and track their availability.
- **Payments**: Secure Stripe integration for handling payments via `django-payments`.
- **UUIDs for Tickets**: Non-obvious unique ticket identifiers for security.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Group tickets by event and manage them in the Django Admin panel.

### üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 4.x
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (basic templates)
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe via `django-payments`
- **Database**: SQLite (default, configurable for other DBs)
- **Human Identification**: ReCAPTCHA via `django-reCAPTCHA`

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
### 1. Set Up a Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv event_venv
source event_venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: event_venv\Scripts\activate
```

Use for example (direnv)[https://direnv.net/] for automatic environment activation.

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
cd event_venv
git clone https://github.com/Kreolis/cinema_ticketing
cd cinema_ticketing
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up the `.env` File
```bash
cd code
```

Create a `.env` file in the `code/cinema_tickets` folder by copying the `template.env` and add at least replace `YourDjangoSecretKey` with a secret key for Django.

To be able to send emails add
```bash
  EMAIL_HOST=localhost
  EMAIL_PORT=587
  EMAIL_USE_TLS=True
  EMAIL_HOST_USER=your-email@example.com
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=your-email-password
  DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

If you want to use the Stripe payment gateway, add your Stripe keys:
```bash
  USE_STRIPE=True
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
  STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your-stripe-public-key
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_test_secret
```

For ReCAPTCHA support add `YourMyRecaptchaKey` / `YourRecaptchaPrivateKey`. 

If you want to use a postgres database set `USE_POSTGRES` to `True` and add the following variables:
```bash
  POSTGRES_DB=your-db-name
  POSTGRES_USER=your-db-user
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your-db-password
  POSTGRES_HOST=your-db-host
  POSTGRES_PORT=your-db-port
```

### 5. Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create_groups
```

### 6. Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### üè¢ Deployment with Nginx

To deploy this project with Nginx, follow these steps:

#### Set Up uWSGI
Install [uWSGI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/UWSGI) and create a folder named `vassals` under `/etc/uwsgi`.
Create a file called `cinema_ticketing.ini` inside the `vassals` folder.

```ini
[uwsgi]
project = cinema_ticketing
uid = www-data # or nginx (the user that governs your websites)
base = /path/to/your/cinema_ticketing_folder

chdir = %(base)/%(project)
home = %(base)/event_venv
module = %(project).wsgi:application

master = true
processes = 5

socket = /run/uwsgi/%(project).sock
chown-socket = www-data:www-data # or nginx (the user that governs your websites)
chmod-socket = 660
vacuum = true

daemonize = /var/log/uwsgi/%(project).log
```

Enable and start the uWSGI emperor service to start serving the side.

```bash
systemctl enable emperor.uwsgi.service
systemctl start emperor.uwsgi.service
```

#### Manage Translation and Static
If you want to translate your application to a different language or want to modify the strings used in this website you have to generate a new translation locale with rosetta. Run this in your `cinema_ticketing` application folder.

```bash
django-admin makemessages -l <language_code>
```

Do not forget to compile your translations:
```bash
python manage.py compilemessages
```

Make sure to collect your static files like .css so that your website is properly styled. Run this in your `cinema_ticketing` application folder.

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

#### Configure Nginx
Install Nginx and create a new configuration file for your project in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` named `cinema_ticketing`.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain_or_IP;

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location /static/ {
        root /path/to/your/cinema_ticketing_folder;
    }

    location / {
        include         uwsgi_params;
        uwsgi_pass      unix:/run/uwsgi/cinema_ticketing.sock;
    }

    error_log /var/log/nginx/cinema_ticketing_error.log;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/cinema_ticketing_access.log;
}
```

Enable the configuration by creating a symbolic link to it in the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory.

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cinema_ticketing /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

Test the Nginx configuration and restart the service.

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

#### Test the Deployment
Visit your server's IP address or domain in your browser to ensure the application is running correctly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Stripe Keys Not Working**: Ensure they are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- **Migrations Fail**: Delete the `db.sqlite3` file and the `migrations` folder in your app, then re-run:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
- **Database Tables are missing**: Create migrations explicitly for the app:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations events
  python manage.py migrate events
  ```
- **Branding object makemigrations OperationalError**: Make sure the branding object is_active is set to FALSE and try again
